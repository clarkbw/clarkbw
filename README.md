### Hello there, I'm Bryan 👋

I am a product manager, developer, and designer; seriously I studied computer science, started my career as a designer and now combine all that into my product management work. 

I've been a tinkerer my whole life, I'm obsessed with how things work. My first computer was a Tandy Sensation which I hacked away at to make it play the latest games.  My second computer I built by myself from parts. I grew up taking things apart, putting them back together and asking endless "why questions". Why is this this way? Why can't it be this way? This curiosity is my super power, I don't stop asking why until I understand things. I love the how and why of things.

I've worked on the Linux Kernel, GNOME Desktop, client side applications (Thunderbird and Firefox) as well as cloud based services (Mozilla Services, GitHub, Timescale) and am looking forward to learning even more.

I view my product work as a craft and am constantly trying to improve my processes and output. Happy to connect with others who want to talk about product process, technology, oh and cycling 🚴
